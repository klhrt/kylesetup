# kylesetup

My personal basic setup. To install, first install Ubuntu 22.04 Server. Then run:
```
git clone https://github.com/klhrt/kylesetup.git
cd kylesetup
chmod u+x .kylesetup.sh
./.kylesetup.sh
```

That's it! edit the shell script if you want to omit the cargo packages; porsmo is a pomodoro timer and ttyper is a terminal typing speed test.
